# Invitation Website (Google Form RSVP)

This version uses your **Google Form** for RSVP.

## How it works
- The RSVP section now has a single **RSVP Here** button that opens your Google Form in a new tab.
- Visitors fill it out, and responses go straight into your Google Form response sheet.

## Quick Start
1. Update event details inside `index.html` (Event Name, Date, Time, Location, Notes).
2. Replace the Canva embed if needed.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel work perfectly (see previous instructions).

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
